2018/06/15-04:40:30 : !!! Start test, script file: tst-smt-01.script

// Script:    Tst-sls-01.script
// Author:    Arndt von Staa
// Date:      10/fev/2007
// Purpose:   Test symbol table
      6 == Reset all spaces
      9 == Preserve the number of allocated spaces
     13 == Create tables
     18 == Verify empty tables
     23 == Test seach in empty table
>>> 1    Line 26  Incorrect symbol search return  Is false, should be true.
<<< 0    Line 27  Expected failure or error has been recovered. 
     29 == Test insert string
     37 == Test delete symbol
     42 == Test mix of insert and delete
     52 == Test insert string in another table
     60 == Verify structure of table with no delete performed
     63 == Verify structure of table with delete performed
     66 == Verify sensibility with respect to case and diacritic characters
>>> 1    Line 70  Incorrect symbol search return  Is false, should be true.
<<< 0    Line 71  Expected failure or error has been recovered. 
     73 == Verify correct comparison at the extremities
     78 == Test random
     93 == Test display collision list lengths
