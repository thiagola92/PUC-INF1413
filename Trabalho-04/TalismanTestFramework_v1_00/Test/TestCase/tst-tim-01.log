// Script:    Tst-cfg-01.script
// Author:    Arndt von Staa
// Date:      26/set/2013
// Purpose:   Test time functions
      6 == Reset all spaces
      9 == Preserve the number of allocated spaces
     12 == Initialize time module
     15 == Get start up time
!!!      Line 16  Start up time is:  2018/06/15-04:40:29
     18 == Wait some time
     21 == Initialize and display, should be different
!!!      Line 24  Start up time is:  2018/06/15-04:40:29
     26 == Get current time
!!!      Line 27  Current time is:  2018/06/15-04:40:29
     29 == Save current clock
     32 == Get elapsed time, current time has not been changed
     35 == Display initialized - wrong - time
!!!      Line 37  Current time is:    -1/-1/-1--1:-1:-1
     39 == Set a base comparison time in clok 4
!!!      Line 43  Clock time is:  2000/01/02-13:40:50
     46 == Set a differing current time, differs only millisecs
!!!      Line 49  Current time is:  2000/01/02-13:40:50
     53 == Get elapsed time
!!!      Line 55  Elapsed time is:  0.120
     57 == Set a differing current time crossing sec boundary within same sec
!!!      Line 61  Elapsed time is:  0.800
     63 == Set a differing current time crossing sec boundary within next sec
!!!      Line 67  Elapsed time is:  1.400
     69 == Set a differing current time crossing sec boundary within same min
!!!      Line 73  Elapsed time is:  59.105
     75 == Set a differing current time crossing sec boundary within next min
!!!      Line 79  Elapsed time is:  1:48.405
     81 == Set a differing current time crossing all boundaries with carry
!!!      Line 84  Elapsed time is:  23:59:59.999
     86 == Set a differing current time an exact day
!!!      Line 89  Elapsed time is:  24:00:00.000
     91 == Set 2 days difference
!!!      Line 94  Elapsed time is:  48:00:00.000
     96 == Set 2 days difference, missing 2 millis
!!!      Line 99  Elapsed time is:  47:59:59.998
    101 == Verify leakage
